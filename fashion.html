Development Team: Anjali Devakumar and Caitlyn Gardiner
<br>
<br>
  After meeting with senior marketing staff and designers, my team understood that TJX wanted to help customers find items that catered to their style but also fit within the constraints of TJX’s fashion model. For example, TJX focuses more on the style attributes of a piece of clothing; customers are not allowed to search by brands on tjmaxx.com to protect the company's designer relationships. With our project, we aimed to address this need by helping customers use their fashion taste to explore what TJMaxx had to offer them. 
<br>
<br>
Therefore, my team presented an artificially intelligent outfit recommendation system that caters to a customer’s style while utilizing TJMaxx’s ever-changing inventory. Our final system consists of a Python backend powered by Microsoft Azure’s Image Recognition API that trains a machine learning model to recognize patterns, colors, and other attributes of clothing. A user can choose a sample outfit, and our system will provide them apparel with similar qualities from tjmaxx.com. Due to development time constraints, we only included tops and bottoms. The front-end website sits on top of the backend and provides a possible integration of the prediction service within tjmaxx.com. 
<br>
<br>
My primary role was developing the Front-End website and managing the API connections. I studied TJMaxx's color scheme and branding to ensure that our prototype matched the website design. The prototype is designed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. After our presentation, this project was picked up by the company for future implementation on tjmaxx.com.
