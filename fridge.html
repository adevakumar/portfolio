<div class="subtitle is-5">Overview </div>
Fridge Helper is a web application prototype that enables users to organize their fridge by prioritizing foods through expiration dates. Each user has a food list that contains all the items in their fridge; users have the option of scanning a grocery receipt and letting our app add the food and its expiration date, or they can manually add items and expiration dates for meals that may not have concrete data (ex: takeout). The app allows users to meal-prep by providing relevant recipes per their dietary restrictions. The goal of the app is to minimize food waste and save money, as well as simplify the process of meal prepping.
<br>
<strong> I was involved in every step of the process, from interviews, building the low-fidelity prototype, and primarily coding the HTML of the high-fidelity prototype. </strong>
<br>
<br>
<div class="subtitle is-5">Target Audience </div> Our target audience is primarily busy parents and students living off campus, but the app can aid anyone who prepares food. We conducted user research by interviewing local parents and students living off campus, and the feedback we received from our target audience drove every iteration cycle. The high-fidelity prototype is designed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I was involved in every step of the process, from interviews, building the low fidelity prototype, and coding portions of the high fidelity prototype.

<div class="subtitle is-5"> User Research </div> 

<div class="columns is-desktop">
  <div class="column is-two-thirds">Competitive Analysis: We started by analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of similar food storage and recipe apps on the market.

A leading competitor for expiration apps is FoodKeeper, a USDA funded app that informs users when their food will expire and contains information regarding storage issues. With FoodKeeper, users need to manually enter information which can cause user frustration if they make typing errors. As for recipe planning, one popular app used is Yummly. Yummly provides many categories for users to filter and search for recipes.The only downside to Yummly is that it still does not entirely fix the issue of needing to find and use multiple food items from your fridge in an easy manner. What differentiates our app from such competitors is the ability to select specific ingredients from your food list and find recipes with those ingredients.</div>

<br>
Knowledge Elicitation: Before making prototypes, we conducted interviews with users in our target audience to determine what aspects of FridgeHelper would benefit them and get suggestions for additional features. For initial meetings, we used an unstructured interview to encourage brainstorming, but once we knew which topics would be good for conversation, we used structured interviews to get direct answers and ensure we received all the information we wanted.  
<br>
<br>
Scenario Development: We developed user personas and scenarios to identify typical app usage and address any holes in our design process. 
<br>
<br>
Sample Persona: Gayle, Age 40.
<li>Housewife and mother of 7
<li>Does most of the cooking and food shopping
<li>Frequently uses her iPhone
<li>Lives in Amherst, MA (suburb)
<br>
<br>
Scenario:
<br>
Setting: Gayle picks up 3 of her kids from soccer practice and heads to the grocery store to buy food. During the trip, her hungry children nag her to purchase items that were not on her list. She exceeds her budget of $150. 
<br>
Actors: Gayle and three of her children (Chad, Conor, Kayleigh)
<br>
Goals:
<li>Plan recipes with ingredients in her fridge
<li>Help her track extra food her children buy
<li>Stick to her budget 
<br>
Actions: 
<li>Gayle logs in to the app, scans her receipt, and manually adds miscellaneous items  
<li>She selects ingredients to generate a recipe for dinner
<br>
Events: Fridge Helper saves receipt data, assigns each item an expiration date and suggests recipes based on the entered data.  
<br>

<div class="subtitle is-5">User Testing and Representative Tasks </div> 
We made sample tasks and had target users perform them to find areas of improvement in our prototype and prioritize implementation changes. 
<br>
<br>
Sample Users:
<br>
John Doe, 20 - Off-campus student, buys groceries weekly
<br>
Felicia Butcher, 43 - stay at home mom. Buys groceries twice a week for her family 
<br>
<br>
Insights from User-Testing
<li>Being able to add the same food twice (3 - high priority)
<li>My Foods shows crossed out items (2)
<li>Not enough spacing between buttons (1)
<li>Add food ‘+’ is hard to read/too small (1)
<br>

High Fidelity Prototype
</a>
</div>
We built our website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We wanted to originally use Xcode/Swift but not everyone in the group had a Macbook. We then moved to Ionic, but the setup was incredibly buggy. Given the timeframe of this project and the focus of the UI, we hardcoded some underlying functionality, like the recipe generator and receipt scanning.
