 <p>For my final project in my Honors Digital Humanities class, our class was challenged to pick a personal problem that would benefit from using smart, immersive technology such as Google Glasses and the Structure Sensor. Inspired by my background in classical piano and my frustration with the current state of online music lessons when I moved away for college, I chose to explore how a traditional piano lesson can be simulated in an online environment. A major drawback of online lessons is that they do not offer both an aerial perspective of the teacher playing the keys and a full body view of the teacher. With the Google Glass and its connected Hangouts app, I aimed to recreate that aerial view that someone can watch in real-time and later on through video calls that could later be uploaded. The Structure Sensor was used to model the piano keyboard and my body posture to give someone an idea of a proper playing posture. </p>

<p>I designed an experiment in which I (the teacher) would wear Google Glasses and attempt to teach a basic scale or a short segment of a piece through the Google Hangouts app. I recruited my friend who does not play the piano to be my student, and she sat in a separate room with a piano with the Hangouts app open on her computer following along. As I sat at the piano, my friend used the Structure Sensor to capture my posture and I edited the models later.</p>

<p>Although I was able to achieve a basic, interactive lesson, future revision on this project is necessary. The Google Glass proved to be intrusive, as its slightly heavy nature caused fatigue and obstructed my view of the keys. It is not a tool to be worn long-term in an intensive task such as this, and the quality of the Hangouts call and a resulting recorded video faced spotty reception and shaky video quality. Because I was constrained by only having 1 Google Glass, the real-time aspect of the lesson could be greatly improved if both the student and teacher could wear Google Glasses to see the finger view. By only seeing the finger view, however, some personability is lost as the teacher and student are unable to see each otherâ€™s faces. The piano room we were conducting the experiment was quite small and the lack of space made the 3D models quite patchy. A normal photo of me taken from multiple angles and annotated would be much clearer to view.</p>

<p>At this stage, online piano learning is more suited to experienced piano players looking to brush up their skills, and not intentioned for first-time learners. Music education has traditionally been face-to-face, and I had a lot of fun trying to explore alternative immersive learning methods.</p>
