<strong>Motivation</strong>: Deceptive phishing refers to an attack by which hackers mimic a legitimate company and attempt to steal a customer's credentials. This attack commonly occurs over email and websites to create a false representation of legitimacy for the average user. Hackers aim to manipulate a user's mental models and visual perception lapses. The more closely a deceptive phishing email resembles the company's official email, the higher the success rate of the phishing attack. The specific language in a phishing email body uses emotionally-charged speech to hinder critical thinking by raising levels of fear, sadness, or anger to compel one to take immediate action. Phishing's tactics are not only successful, but they also pose disastrous consequences to individual users, by causing identity theft, and to Fortune 100 Companies, in the form of data breaches. <br>
<br>
<strong>Thesis Objective</strong>: I redesign a standard email web interface to present pertinent information that can aid a user in classifying whether a redirected link is legitimate or not. As security is not the primary concern, people accidentally click on malicious URLs because they do not take the time to look at the URL carefully. 
<br>
<br>
I want my implemented features to improve the design and presentation of URLs within the email - this can be in regards to size, color, and many more aspects. Previous studies focus more on security messaging in the browser, but I aim to shift the focus to emails. Users typically end up on spoofed websites by clicking on hyperlinks within the malicious email. I reviewed cognitive psychology literature to identify design principles that can help create new, effective security messaging. Cognitive psychology provides insight into how users make decisions, prioritize information, or learn skills. When using a web or mobile interface, humans rely on their vision to form judgments, process information and allocate attention to objects. Therefore, by incorporating cognitive psychology, I gain insight on how humans interact and perceive information on an interface, and having this solid background allows my redesign to be in line with a user’s typical behavior.
<br>
<br>
My design aims to prevent the user from even clicking on a hyperlink if there is any doubt of its legitimacy. I also intend to give the end user the final say in the legitimacy of a link as well as provide discrete choices to help them make an informed decision about the URL.  Despite current browser indicators, at this stage, people are still going to be the best at validating whether a URL is secure. By presenting the URL in line with typical browsing behavior, the user has a more proactive indicator of the redirected website's legitimacy.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Literature Review</strong>: Through the literature review, I had a few focuses. I aimed to learn more about user behavior through phishing. I wanted to find out who is more at risk for falling for phishing attacks, the physiological and psychological impact of phishing, and existing solutions within research, employee training, and general user awareness. Another focus of the literature review was

<strong> Design Goals </strong>
<li>Strike a balance between the email system and a human user’s ability to identify a malicious email </li>
<li>Increased focus on providing relevant information and understandable language (no technical jargon)</li>
<li>Design will guide users with distinct choices to complete their task, but user is in control</li>
<li>Potential consequences and recommendations should be conveyed</li>

<strong> Final Designs - Spotify Sample Email </strong>
<br>
<br>
When developing my Usability experiment, I divided participants into 2 groups. The first group is No Design Interventions and the second group is Design Interventions, or email designs with my changes. I hypothesized that participants who saw emails with my interventions would be less likely to fall for phishing.
