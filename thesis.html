Background: Deceptive phishing refers to an attack by which hackers mimic a legitimate company and attempt to steal a customer's credentials. This attack commonly occurs over email and websites to create a false representation of legitimacy for the average user. Hackers aim to manipulate a user's mental models and visual perception lapses. The more closely a deceptive phishing email resembles the company's official email, the higher the success rate of the phishing attack. The specific language in a phishing email body uses emotionally-charged speech to hinder critical thinking by raising levels of fear, sadness, or anger to compel one to take immediate action. Phishing's tactics are not only successful, but they also pose disastrous consequences to individual users, by causing identity theft, and to Fortune 100 Companies, in the form of data breaches. <br>
<br>
Thesis Objective: I redesign existing email interfaces to present pertinent information that can aid a user in classifying whether a redirected link is legitimate or not. As security is not the primary concern, people accidentally click on malicious URLs because they do not take the time to look at the URL carefully. 
<br>
<br>
I want my implemented features to improve the design and presentation of URLs within the email - this can be in regards to size, color, and many more aspects. Previous studies focus more on security messaging in the browser, but I aim to shift the focus to emails. Users typically end up on spoofed websites by clicking on hyperlinks within the malicious email. My design aims to prevent the user from even clicking on a hyperlink if there is any doubt of its legitimacy. I also intend to give the end user the final say in the legitimacy of a link as well as provide discrete choices to help them make an informed decision about the URL.  Despite current browser indicators, at this stage, people are still going to be the best at validating whether a URL is secure. By presenting the URL in line with typical browsing behavior, the user has a more proactive indicator of the redirected website's legitimacy.
<br>
<br>
<p>I am currently in my second semester of research, and I am designing prototypes with my suggested design changes. I will create an experiment later this semester that sees users interacting with regular emails and my redesigned emails, and see how effective my changes are in preventing phishing.
